            <p>Spamming is the process of posting unwanted and not related comments on specific posts
                 in any type of social sharing medium or video sharing medium. These messages are posted
                  by bots for reducing ranking or disturbing users viewing experience which ultimately reduces 
                  the rank of website and post. This spamming is done manually also which are mostly seen in 
                  most competitive pages. There are few method which can remove spamming methods which use data
                   mining techniques but in this project we are automating process of spam comment detection using machine 
                   learning by taking dataset of YouTube spam messages and applying CountVectorizer
                 and Naive Bayes algorithm for clustering on given data set using python programming.</p>
